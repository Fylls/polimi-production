# Production 4.0

<br>

This initiative aims at exploiting the learning-by-playing principles to give students the possibility of understanding the most common issues in the design and development of a manufacturing cell. The main goal is to stimulate learners' creativity when dealing with diverse disciplines such as mechanical design, industrial production, process digitization, communication, and work organization.

The student will work in a multidisciplinary team to design a manufacturing cell composed of 8 production modules for 3D printing, laser processing, and machining to make real products; a 3D scanner, a light microscope, and a tension testing machine to verify the manufactured products.
 
Our case study is focused on the Advanced Manufacturing Processes for custom PCBs.
